# knights_travails

1. The code defines a Node class to represent positions (x, y) on the chessboard. This class is used to create objects representing the knight's position during the BFS traversal.

2. The isValidMove function checks if a given position (x, y) is a valid move on the 8x8 chessboard. It returns true if the move is valid and false otherwise.

3. The generatePossibleMoves function calculates all possible moves from a given position (x, y) for a knight on the chessboard. It uses the availableMoves array to generate the next potential positions and filters out invalid moves.

4. The knightsShortestPath function finds the shortest path for a knight on the chessboard using BFS. It starts by initializing a queue with the starting position as the first element. A visited set is used to keep track of visited positions.

5. The BFS loop continues until the queue becomes empty, meaning all possible paths have been explored.

6. Inside the BFS loop, the current path is dequeued from the queue, and the last position of the path is extracted to get the current x and y coordinates.

7. If the current x and y match the end position, it means we have found the shortest path, and the path is returned as the result.

8. If the end position is not reached, the code generates all possible moves from the current position using the generatePossibleMoves function. For each valid move (child), the next position is checked if it has been visited before. If the position has not been visited, it is added to the visited set, and the updated path is enqueued back into the queue for further exploration.

9. If the end position is not reachable, the function returns null, indicating that there is no valid path between the start and end positions.

10. This code efficiently finds the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard using BFS, considering all possible valid moves the knight can make. It's a complete and correct implementation, ready to be used in the README.md file of your GitHub repository.
